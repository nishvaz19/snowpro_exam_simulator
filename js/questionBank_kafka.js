    question: "How does 'Swap' usage on a Linux server affect Kafka performance?",
    options: [
      "It makes it faster",
      "It is extremely detrimental, as paging to disk causes long latency spikes and pauses; swap should usually be disabled",
      "It has no effect on Java",
      "It only affects the logs"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "If Kafka's process gets swapped to disk, performance will drop by orders of magnitude. Production servers should have 'swappiness' set to 1 or 0.",
    hint: "Disk-based RAM is too slow."

    options: [
      "A service that doesn't use a database",

    question: "What is the 'Log Cleaner' thread's impact on Broker I/O?",
    options: [
      "It reduces I/O",
      "It increases disk I/O because it has to read and write segments during the compaction process",
      "It has no impact",
      "It only affects the network"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Compaction is a background I/O intensive task. It should be scheduled or throttled during peak production hours if disk I/O is a bottleneck.",
    hint: "Background maintenance cost."
