options:[
"Columns with low cardinality like 'Gender'",
"Columns frequently used in join keys or filter predicates with high cardinality",

"It allows for flexible, non-indexed data clustering that can evolve without rewriting the table",
"It only works on Parquet files, not Delta"
],
answer:2,
explanation:"Liquid clustering replaces fixed partitioning and Z-order with a flexible layout that simplifies tuning and supports evolving query patterns."

{
id:40,
difficulty:"medium",
category:"delta_lake",
question:"A user wants to query a Delta table as it existed 10 days ago. The VACUUM command was run yesterday with a 7-day retention. What happens?",
options:[
"The query succeeds normally",
"The query fails because the required underlying data files were deleted",
"The query returns the current data instead",
"The query triggers an automatic RESTORE"
