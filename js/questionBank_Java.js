      "It requires the method to be static",
      "It only works with private methods"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Spring uses AOP proxies for @Async. If you call the method from within the same class (this.method()), you bypass the proxy, and the task will not be executed in a separate thread."

    question: "What happens to the SecurityContext (authenticated user) when a method is called with @Async?",
    options: [
      "It is automatically copied to the new thread",
      "It is lost because the new thread has its own context, unless specifically configured to propagate",
      "The application crashes",
      "The user is automatically logged out"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Threads do not share ThreadLocal variables by default. To propagate security or tracing contexts, you must configure a specific TaskDecorator."

    question: "What is the 'Leftmost Prefix' rule for a composite index on (Column_A, Column_B, Column_C)?",
    options: [
      "The index can only be used if all three columns are in the WHERE clause",
      "The index can optimize queries for (A), (A, B), or (A, B, C), but NOT for queries filtering only on (B) or (C)",
      "The index only works if the columns are sorted alphabetically in the table",
      "The index is used for the column with the longest name first"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Composite indexes are ordered. A query must filter by the first column in the index for the database to use the index efficiently to find subsequent columns."

    id: 310,
    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "Database",
    question: "What is a 'Covering Index' and how does it improve performance?",
    options: [
      "It is an index that covers the primary key only",
      "It is an index that contains all columns requested by a query, allowing the database to skip reading the actual table rows",
      "It is an index that encrypts the data",
      "It is an index that automatically updates all other indexes"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "If an index contains all fields needed for the SELECT and WHERE clauses, the database performs an 'Index-Only Scan,' which avoids expensive row fetches from the disk."

    id: 311,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "Database",
    question: "Why should you generally avoid creating an index on a column with 'Low Cardinality' (e.g., a boolean)?",
    options: [
      "It consumes too much RAM",
      "The database engine often determines that a full table scan is more efficient than using a non-selective index",
      "Low cardinality columns cannot be indexed in SQL",
      "It causes the database to crash during high traffic"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "If a value appears in a large percentage of rows (like 50%), searching the index and then jumping to table pages is usually slower than just reading the whole table."

      "To run queries at a scheduled time at night",
      "To group multiple SQL statements together and send them to the database in one network call",
      "To backup the database automatically",
      "To convert SQL queries into JSON"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Batch processing (addBatch/executeBatch) allows sending multiple operations in one network round-trip, drastically increasing performance for bulk inserts/updates."

      "PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW",
      "PROPAGATION_MANDATORY",
      "PROPAGATION_NESTED"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "REQUIRES_NEW starts a new, independent transaction. If the inner transaction fails, it can be handled without necessarily rolling back the outer transaction."

    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "Microservices",
    question: "What is 'Eventual Consistency' in the context of asynchronous microservices?",
    options: [
      "The system will never be consistent",
      "Data across services will eventually become consistent after some time, rather than being updated instantly",
      "All databases are updated at the exact same microsecond",
      "It is a bug in the system"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "In distributed systems, we trade immediate consistency (ACID) for availability. Services sync up via events, leading to a small delay where data might be briefly inconsistent."

    id: 315,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "Microservices",
    question: "In asynchronous communication, how does the 'Transactional Outbox' pattern ensure reliability?",
    options: [
      "By sending the message to Kafka before saving to the database",
      "By saving the event in a local database table as part of the same transaction as the business logic",
      "By using only synchronous REST calls",
      "By encrypting the message broker"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "It ensures atomicity: either both business data and the event are saved, or neither is. A separate relayer then publishes messages from the outbox table to the broker."

    question: "What is the primary purpose of the 'volatile' keyword in Java multithreading?",
    options: [
      "To make a variable thread-safe and atomic",
      "To ensure visibility of variable changes across threads by preventing local caching",
      "To lock a block of code so only one thread can enter",
      "To prevent a variable from being garbage collected"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Volatile ensures that every read of a variable comes from main memory and every write goes directly to main memory, preventing threads from seeing stale cached values. It does NOT ensure atomicity."

    question: "How does 'ReentrantLock' provide more flexibility than the 'synchronized' keyword?",
    options: [
      "It is faster in all scenarios",
      "It is automatically released by the JVM",
      "It offers features like tryLock() with timeouts, fair locking, and multiple Condition variables",
      "It can only be used on classes, not methods"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Unlike synchronized, ReentrantLock allows for non-blocking lock attempts (tryLock), the ability to interrupt a thread waiting for a lock, and fairness policies to prevent thread starvation."

    options: [
      "The map size is doubled immediately",
      "The bucket is converted from a linked list to a balanced Red-Black Tree to improve search time from O(n) to O(log n)",
      "The extra items are moved to a new bucket",
      "An Exception is thrown"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "To prevent performance degradation during high collision scenarios, Java 8 converts lists to trees once a bucket reaches 8 entries (provided the total map capacity is at least 64)."

    question: "What is the difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap()?",
    options: [
      "ConcurrentHashMap locks the entire map; synchronizedMap locks segments",
      "ConcurrentHashMap uses fine-grained locking (segments or CAS) allowing concurrent reads/writes; synchronizedMap locks the whole object",
      "synchronizedMap is faster for multithreaded apps",
      "ConcurrentHashMap allows null keys and values"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "ConcurrentHashMap allows multiple threads to access different parts of the map simultaneously without blocking each other, whereas synchronizedMap requires every thread to wait for a single global lock."

      "It works on a clone/snapshot of the collection (e.g., CopyOnWriteArrayList) and does not throw exceptions if the original is modified",
      "It prevents any other thread from modifying the collection",
      "It only works with primitive types"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Fail-safe iterators operate on a copy of the data. This allows iteration to continue safely even if the original collection is modified by another thread."

      "They are the same thing",
      "API Gateway handles North-South traffic (client to server); Service Mesh handles East-West traffic (service to service)",
      "Service Mesh is for UI only",
      "API Gateway is used to store database passwords"

      "It must not have any NULL values",
      "It must be split into at least 10 tables"
    ],
